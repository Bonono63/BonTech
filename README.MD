# Complex Engineering / Over Engineering / BonTech

Different basins based on the form of heat produciton or how the subject has energy applied, particularly for metals as they will need to be refined in large quantities and efficiently.

Subject type ei: metals vs food
material type ei: iron vs steel
energy type ei: electricity vs heat
speed vs efficiency correlates with material type,
different materials should maintain heat better (the material inside the basin should also have an effect on how fast it heats up or whether it maintains heat) or lose heat faster
The maximum heat tolerance and capacity should also correlate with material ie: tensile strength
